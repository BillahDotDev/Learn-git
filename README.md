# Learn git 
## What is git?
Git as a time machine for your code. It keeps track of every change you make to your files, so if you ever mess something up or want to go back to an earlier version, you can do it easily. It also helps you collaborate with others on the same code without stepping on each other's toes. So, in short, Git helps you manage your code's history and work together with others smoothly.


1. Installing Git:
   
      • First, you need to install Git on your computer. You can download it from the official website (https://git-scm.com/), and the installation process is usually 
         straightforward.

2. Configuring Git:

      • After installing Git, you should configure your username and email address using the following commands:
            
            git config --global user.name "Your Name"
         
            git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
   
      Replace "Your Name" and "youremail@example.com" with your actual name and email address.

3. Initializing a Repository:
   
    • To start using Git in a project, navigate to its directory in your terminal or command prompt and run:
      
            git init
   
      This command initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.
